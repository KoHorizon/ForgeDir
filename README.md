A flexible, YAML-driven CLI tool written in Go to automate the creation of project directory and file structures.

---

## ‚ú® Overview

Initializing a new project often involves manually creating nested folders and placeholder files. **ForgeDir** streamlines this setup by reading a simple YAML spec and instantly scaffolding the desired layout.

This tool is under active development and doubles as a practical learning project for Go developers focusing on building CLI apps and implementing clean architecture principles.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **YAML-driven**: Define any nested directory/file hierarchy in a human-readable YAML format.
* **Fast & Lightweight**: Leverages Go's standard library‚Äîno external dependencies for the core scaffold.
* **Extensible**: Built with a plugin-ready generator system for future language-agnostic boilerplate.
* **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## üîß Getting Started

ForgeDir aims to simplify scaffolding new projects by interpreting a YAML configuration and generating the necessary directory and file structure automatically. Installation and detailed usage instructions will be provided in a future update.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Directory structure follows Cobra conventions:

```
cmd/       # CLI entrypoints
internal/  # Core builder, config loader, and generator logic
```

Use `go run main.go` for rapid iteration without rebuilding.
